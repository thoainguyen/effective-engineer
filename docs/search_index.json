speed\n\n\nInvest in iteration speed\nContinuous developement\nFeature flag\nMove fast learn fast\nInvest in time-saving tools\nShorten your debugging and validation loops\nMastering your programming environment\nDon't ignore your non-engineering bottlenecks\n\n\n\nContinuous developement\n\n“Why is continuous deployment such a powerful tool? Fundamentally, it allows engineers to make and deploy small, incremental changes rather than the larger, batched changes typical at other companies. That shift in approach eliminates a significant amount of overhead associated with traditional release processes, making it easier to reason about changes and enabling engineers to iterate much more quickly.”\n\n“If someone finds a bug, for instance, continuous deployment makes it possible to implement a fix, deploy it to production, and verify that it works—all in one sitting. With more traditional workflows, those three phases might be split over multiple days or weeks; the engineer has to make the fix, wait days for it to be packaged up with other bigger changes in the week’s release, and then validate that fix along with a slew of other orthogonal changes. Much more context switching and mental overhead are required.”\n“Because changes come in smaller batches, it’s also easier to debug problems when they’re identified. ”\nFeature flag\n“Just because changes are deployed incrementally, however, doesn’t mean that larger features aren’t possible or that users see half-finished features. A large feature gets gated behind a configuration flag, which is disabled until the feature is ready. The same configuration flag often allows teams to selectively enable a feature for internal team members, beta users, or some fraction of production traffic until the feature is ready. In practice, this also means that changes get merged incrementally into the master code repository. Teams then avoid the intense coordination and “merge hell” that often accompanies longer release cycles as they scramble to integrate large chunks of new code and get them to work together correctly”\n\n“Focusing on small, incremental changes also opens the door to new development techniques that aren’t possible in traditional release workflows. Suppose that in a product discussion, we’re debating whether we should keep a certain feature. Rather than letting opinions and politics dictate the feature’s importance or waiting for the next release cycle to start gathering usage data, we could simply log the interaction we care about, deploy it, and start seeing the initial data trickle in within minutes.”\n\nMove fast learn fast\n\n“Facebook’s culture emphasizes iterating quickly and focusing on impact rather than being conservative and minimizing mistakes. The company might not use continuous deployment in production, but it has managed to effectively scale its workflow so that over a thousand engineers are able to deploy code to facebook.com twice a day. That’s an impressive feat.”\n\nThe faster that you can iterate, the more that you can learn about what works and what doesn’t work. You can build more things and try out more ideas.\nMoving fast doesn't necessarily mean moving recklessly\nInvest in time-saving tools\n“Bobby Johnson, a former Facebook Director of Infrastructure Engineering, told me, “I’ve found that almost all successful people write a lot of tools … ”\n\n“Consider two engineers, Mark and Sarah, working on two separate projects. Mark dives head first into his project and spends his next two months building and launching a number of features. Sarah, on the other hand, notices that her workflow isn’t as fast it could be. She spends her first two weeks fixing her workflow—setting up incremental compilation of her code, configuring her web server to automatically reload newly compiled code, and writing a few automation scripts to make it easier to set up a test user’s state on her development server. These improvements speed up her development cycles by 33%. Mark was able to get more done initially, but after two months, Sarah catches up—and her remaining six weeks’ worth of feature work is as productive as Mark’s eight weeks’. Moreover, Sarah continues to move 33% faster than Mark even after those first two months, producing significantly more work going forward.”\n\nSwitching to languages with interactive programming environments can have a similar effect. In Java, testing out a small expression or function entails a batch workflow of writing, compiling, and running an entire program. One advantage that languages like Scala or Clojure, two languages that run on the Java Virtual Machine, have over Java itself is their ability to evaluate expressions quickly and interactively within a read-eval-print loop, or REPL. This doesn’t save time just because the read-eval-print loop is faster than the edit-compile-run-debug loop; it also saves time because you end up interactively evaluating and testing many more small expressions or functions that you wouldn’t have done before.\nIt’s wishful thinking to believe that all the code we write will be bug-free and work the first time. In actuality, much of our engineering time is spent either debugging issues or validating that what we’re building behaves as expected. The sooner we internalize this reality, the sooner we will start to consciously invest in our iteration speed in debugging and validation loops.\nShorten your debugging and validation loops\n\nA minimal, reproducible test case removes all unnecessary distractions so that more time and energy can be spent on the core issue, and it creates a tight feedback loop so that we can iterate quickly.\n\nMastering your programming environment\n\nGiven how much time we spend in our programming environments, the more efficient we can become, the more effective we will be as engineers.\n\n“The key is to be mindful of which of your common, everyday actions slow you down, and then figure out how to perform those actions more efficiently. Fortunately, decades of software engineers have preceded us; chances are, others have already built the tools we need to accelerate our most common workflows. Often, all we need to do is to invest our time to learn them well.”\nHere are some ways you can get started on mastering your programming fundamentals:\n\nGet proficient with your favorite text editor or IDE\n\nLearn at least one productive, high level programming language\n\nGet familiar with Unix (or Windows) shell commands\n\nPrefer the keyboard over the mouse\n\nAutomate your manual workflows\n\nTest your ideas on an interactive interpreter\n\nMake it fast and easy to run just the unit tests associated with your current changes\n\n\n\nUse testing tools that run only the subset of tests affected by your code. Even better, integrate the tool with your text editor or IDE so that you can invoke them with a few keystrokes.\n\nDon't ignore your non-engineering bottlenecks\n\nOne common type of bottleneck is dependency on other people\n\nCommunication is critical for making progress on people-related bottlenecks. Ask for updates and commitments from team members at meetings or daily stand-ups. Periodically check in with that product manager to make sure what you need hasn’t gotten dropped. Follow up with written communication (email or meeting notes) on key action items and dates that were decided in-person. Projects fail from under-communicating, not over-communicating. Even if resource constraints preclude the dependency that you want from being delivered any sooner, clarifying priorities and expectations enables you to plan ahead and work through alternatives.\n\nAnother common type of bottleneck is obtaining approval from a key decision maker, typically an executive at the company.\n\nDon’t wait until after you’ve invested massive amounts of engineering time to seek final project approval. Instead, prioritize building prototypes, collecting early data, conducting user studies, or whatever else is necessary to get preliminary project approval. Explicitly ask the decision makers what they care about the most, so that you can make sure to get those details right. If meeting with the decision makers isn’t possible, talk with the product managers, designers, or other leaders who have worked closely with them and who might be able to provide insight into their thought processes.\n\nA third type of bottleneck is the review processes that accompany any project launch, whether they be verification by the quality assurance team, a scalability or reliability review by the performance team, or an audit by the security team.\n\nIt's easy to get so focused on getting a feature to work that you defer these reviews to the last minute only to realize that the team that needs to sign off on your work hadn’t been aware of your launch plans and won’t be available until two weeks from now. Plan ahead. Expend slightly more effort in coordination; it could make a significant dent in your iteration speed. Get the ball rolling on the requirements in your launch checklist, and don’t wait until the last minute to schedule necessary reviews. Again, communication is key to ensure that review processes don’t become bottlenecks.\n"},"05-measure-what-you-want-to-improve.html":{"url":"05-measure-what-you-want-to-improve.html","title":"05-measure-what-you-want-to-improve","keywords":"","body":"Measure what you want to improve\n\n\nMeasure what you want to improve\nUse metrics to drive process\nPick the Right metric to incentivize the behaviour you want\n\n\n\n\nMy experience at Google demonstrated the power of a well-chosen metric and its ability to tackle a wide range of problems. Google runs thousands of live traffic search experiments per year, and their reliance on metrics played a key role in ensuring search quality and building their market share\n\nUse metrics to drive process\nMeasuring progress and performance might seem to fall within your manager’s purview, but it’s actually a powerful tool for assessing your own effectiveness and prioritizing your work.\n\n\"If you can't mesure it, you can't improve it\" (Peter Drucker)\n\nGood metrics accomplish a number of goals:\n\nHelp you focus on the right things. They confirm that your product changes - and all the effort you're put into them - actually achieve your objectives.\nWhen visualized over time, good metrics help guard against fututre regressions.\n\nWithout a dashboard of signup rates, application latency, and other useful metrics, it would be hard to identify many of these regressions.\n\n\nGood metrics can drive forward progress. \n\n“In a conversation I had with Sam Schillace, Box’s VP of Engineering, he explained a technique called performance ratcheting that they now use to address this problem and apply downward pressure on performance metrics. In mechanics, a ratchet is a device that allows a wheel with many teeth along its edge to rotate in one direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction. At Box, they use metrics to set a threshold that they call a performance ratchet. Any new change that would push latency or other key indicators past the ratchet can’t get deployed until it’s optimized, or until some other feature is improved by a counterbalancing amount.”\n\n\nA good metric lets you measure your effectiveness over time and compare the leverage of what you’re doing against other activities you could be doing instead.\n\n\nPick the Right metric to incentivize the behaviour you want\n\nWe tend to be good at solving problems and optimizing a metric once it’s been set. However, it’s crucial to remember that the choice of which metric to measure dramatically impacts and influences the type of work that we do. The right metric functions as a North Star, aligning team efforts toward a common goal; the wrong metric leads to efforts that might be ineffective or even counterproductive.\n\nWeekly active users vs. weekly active rate by age of cohort\n When tracking user engagement, the number of weekly active users doesn’t provide a complete picture. In fact, that number might increase temporarily even if product changes are actually reducing engagement over time. Users could be signing up as a result of prior momentum, before there’s time for the long-term effects of the changes to be reflected in the gross numbers. And they might be more likely to churn and abandon the product after signing up than before. An alternative and more accurate metric would be the weekly active rate by age of cohort. In other words, measure the fraction of users who are still weekly actives the nth week after signing up, and track how that number changes over time. This metric provides more actionable insight into how product changes have affected the engagement of newer cohorts of users as compared to older ones.\n What you don't measure is important as well.\n\nIn Delivering Happiness, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh shares a story of how he built a culture of great customer service by making a key decision about what not to measure. Most call centers assess the performance of customer service representatives using their “average handle time.” This measures the average number of minutes it takes an employee to handle a customer call. Reducing this metric saves costs because employees handle more phone calls per day—but this was something that Hsieh didn’t actually want to optimize for. “This [metric] translates into reps worrying about how quickly they can get a customer off the phone, which in our eyes is not delivering great customer service,” Hsieh explains. “At Zappos, we don’t measure call times (our longest phone call was almost six hours long!) … We just care about whether the rep goes above and beyond for every customer.” This decision enabled Zappos to distinguish itself in customer service\n\n Picking the right metric applies to your personal goals as well as your professional ones\n\nI knew writing this book would be a long and challenging project, so I established the habit of writing every day. Early on, I set a goal of writing for at least three hours per day, and I kept track of my progress. What I noticed after a few weeks, however, was that I would spend much of those three hours re-reading and re-writing to perfect my sentences. In fact, some days after editing, I actually would end up with fewer words than I had started out with initially. Great writers like Stephen King and Mark Twain underscore the importance of revision, but I knew that I was rewriting too much too early, and that I would be better off drafting more chapters. And so, I changed my metric. Rather than focusing on writing three hours per day, I focused on writing 1,000 words per day. Some days, that took me two hours; other days, it took four or five. The new metric incentivized me to focus on drafting new content rather than focusing on sentence quality—something I could revisit at a later time. That simple change was all I needed to significantly increase my writing pace.\n\nThe  more complex the product and the goal, the more options there are for what to measure and not to measure. When deciding which metrics to use, choose ones that:\n\nmaximize impact: should be the ones that when systematically increased over time, leads you and the rest of the team to make the greatest and most sustainable impact.\nactionable: \n\nAn actionable metric is one whose movements can be causally explained by the team’s efforts.\nBe vigilant to vanity metrics, as Eric Ries explains in The Lean startup  \n\n\nresponsive & robust: metrics should be updated timely and robust to noise.\n\n\nInstrument Everything to Understand What's Going on\n\nAdopting a mindset of instrumentation means ensuring we have a set of dashboards that surface key health metrics and that enable us to drill down to the relevant data. However, many of the questions we want to answer tend to be exploratory, since we often don’t know everything that we want to measure ahead of time. Therefore, we need to build flexible tools and abstractions that make it easy to track additional metrics.\n\nEtsy, a company that sells handmade crafts online, does this exceptionally well. The engineering team instruments their web application according to their philosophy of “measure anything, measure everything.” 29 They release code and application configurations over 25 times per day, and they move quickly by investing time in gathering metrics for their servers, application behavior, network performance, and the countless other inputs that drive their platform. To do this effectively, they use a system called Graphite that supports flexible, real-time graphing, 30 and a library called StatsD for aggregating metrics. A single line of code lets them define a new counter or timer on the fly, track statistics every time the code is executed, and automatically generate a time series graph that can be transformed and composed with any number of other metrics. They measure everything including “numbers of new registrations, shopping carts, items sold, image uploaded, forum posts, and application errors.” 32 By graphically correlating these metrics with the times of code deployments, they’re able to quickly spot when a certain deployment goes awry.\nInternalize useful numbers\nOptimize MySQL configuration (Percona Consultant)\n\nWe’ve generally seen just about everything people throw at databases,” explains Percona consultant Baron Schwartz. “Tagging, friends, queues, click tracking, search, paginated displays—we’ve seen these and dozens of other common patterns done a hundred different ways.\" As a result, they’ve internalized useful numbers that they can use to benchmark a particular system’s performance. They might not know exactly how much better your system might behave with a certain change, but they can compare your performance with expected numbers and let you know what’s going well and what has ample room for improvement. In contrast, someone less knowledgeable would need to test various MySQL configurations or architectures and measure what difference (if any) the changes made. This, of course, would take significantly more time. The knowledge of useful numbers provides a valuable shortcut for knowing where to invest effort to maximize gains.\n\nWhen it comes to building software systems, for example, Jeff Dean —a long-time Googler who has been instrumental in building many of the company’s core abstractions like Protocol Buffers, MapReduce, and BigTable, as well as key systems like search, indexing, advertising, and language translation has shared a list of 13 numbers that every engineer ought to know.\n\nKnowing useful numbers like these enables you, with a few back-of-the-envelope calculations, to quickly estimate the performance properties of a design without actually having to build it. Suppose you’re building a data storage system, a messaging system, or some other application with persistent storage where performance is important. In these systems, writes need to be persisted to disk, but data is often cached in memory to improve read performance. What kind of read and write throughput can we expect? You might reason that:\n\nYour writes will go to disk, and since each disk seek takes 10 ms, you can do at most 100 writes per second.\nYour reads hit the in-memory cache, and since it takes 250 μs to read 1MB from memory, you can read 4GB per second.\nIf your in-memory objects are no more than 1MB in size, you can read at least 4,000 objects per second from memory.\n\nThat means that in this standard design, you can handle reads roughly 40x faster than you can handle writes.\nInternalizing useful numbers can also help you spot anomalies in data measurements.\nKnowledge of useful numbers can clarify both the areas and scope for improvement.\nBe skeptical about Data Integrity\nUsing data to support your arguments is powerful. The right metric can slice through office politics, philosophical biases, and product arguments, quickly resolving discussions. Unfortunately, the wrong metric can do the same thing with disastrous results. And that means we have to be careful how we use data.\n\nSam Schillace, who ran engineering for Google Apps before his role at Box, warned, “One of my counter-intuitive lessons from Google is that all data can be abused … People interpret data the way they want to interpret it.” Sometimes, we pick easy-to-measure or slightly irrelevant metrics, and use them to tell a false narrative about what’s happening. Other times, we confuse correlation with causality. We might see users spending more time on a newly redesigned feature and optimistically attribute it to increased engagement—when in reality, they are struggling to understand a confusing interface. Or perhaps we’ve made a change to improve search results and celebrate when we see that ad click-through rates are increasing—but users actually are clicking on ads because the search quality dropped. Or maybe we see a sustained spike in page views and celebrate the organic growth—but a large fraction of the new requests had really just come from a single user who had deployed a bot to automatically scrape product data.\n\n“When I asked Schillace how to protect ourselves against data abuse, he argued that our best defense is skepticism.”\nUntrustworthy data that gets incorporated into decision-making processes provides negative leverage. It may lead teams to make the wrong decision or waste cognitive cycles second-guessing themselves. Unfortunately, it’s all too common for engineers to underinvest in data integrity, for a few reasons:\n\nSince engineers often work against tight deadlines,metrics—whose importance only shows up after launch—can get deprioritized.\n\n\nWhen building a new product or feature, it’s much easier to test and validate their interactions than to verify whether some seemingly plausible metric (like page views) is actually accurate.\n\nEngineers reason that because their metrics-related code was well unit-tested, the metrics themselves also should be accurate, even though there could be system-level errors or incorrect assumptions.\n\n\nThe net result is that metrics-related code tends to be less robust than code for other features. Errors can get introduced anywhere in the data collection or processing pipeline.\n\nData can get dropped when sent over the network, leading to inaccurate ground truth data. When data from multiple sources get merged, not paying attention to how different teams interpreted the definitions, units, or standards for what ought to have been logged can introduce inconsistencies.\n\nGiven the importance of metrics, investing the effort to ensure that your data is accurate is high-leverage. Here are some strategies that you can use to increase confidence in your data integrity:\n\nLog data liberally, in case it turns out to be useful later on.\n\nBuild tools to iterate on data accuracy sooner. Real-time analytics address this issue, as do tools that visualize collected data during development. \n\nWrite end-to-end integration tests to validate your entire analytics pipeline\n\nExamine collected data sooner. Even if you need to wait weeks or months to have enough data for a meaningful analysis, check the data sooner to ensure that a sufficient amount was logged correctly.\n\nCross-validate data accuracy by computing the same metric in multiple ways. This is a great way to sanity check that the number is in the right ballpark\n\nWhen a number does look off, dig in to it early. Understand what’s going on. Figure out whether the discrepancy is due to a bug, a misinterpretation, or something else.\n\n\n"},"06-validate-your-ideas-early-and-often.html":{"url":"06-validate-your-ideas-early-and-often.html","title":"06-validate-your-ideas-early-and-often","keywords":"","body":"Validate Your Ideas Early and Often\n\n\nValidate Your Ideas Early and Often\nFind low-effort ways to validate your work\nContinuously validate product changes with A/B Testing\nBeware the One-Person Team\nBuild feedback loops for your decisions\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing for feedback as soon as posible - in other words, understanding what customers actually want and then iterating on that feedback\n\nFind low-effort ways to validate your work\n\nWhen building an MVP, you want to focus on high-leverage activities that can validate hypotheses about your users as much as possible, using as little effort as possible, to maximize the chances that the product will succeed.\n\nSometimes, building an MVP requires being creative. When Drew Houston first started building Dropbox, an easy-to-use file-sharing tool, there were already countless other file-sharing applications on the market. Houston believed that users would prefer the seamless user experience his product could provide—but how could he validate this belief? His solution was to make a short 4-minute video as his MVP. Houston demoed a limited version of his product, showing files synchronizing seamlessly across a Mac, a Windows PC, and the web...\nWe might not all be working on startup products, but the principles of validating our work with small effort holds true for many engineering projects.\nOne way to validate your ideas would be spend 10% of your effort building a small, informative prototype. Depending on your project goals, you can use your prototype for anything from measuring performance on a representative workload, to comparing the code footprint of the module you rewrote against the original module, to assesing the ease of adding new features.\nThe strategy of faking the full implementation of an idea to validate whether it will work is extremely powerful. At one point, Asana, a company that builds collaboration and task management software, was considering whether to implement a new Google Signup button on its home page. Its goal was to increase signups. Rather than building the entire signup flow, they validated the idea by adding a fake signup button: when visitors clicked the button, a pop-up message appeared, reading, “Thanks for your interest—the feature is coming soon.” Asana engineers measured the click-through rates over a few days, and only built out the full flow after the data confirmed that it would help with signups\nThe list of scenarios in which small validations can save your time goes on and on. \n\nMaybe you have an idea of a scoring algorightm that you believe will improve ranking for a news feed. Rather than spending weeks building a production-quality system and running it over all the data, you can asses the new scoring metric on a small subset of data. \n\nYou may have a brilliant product design idea, rather than building it in code, you can hack together a paper prototype or low-fidelity mock to show your teammates or participants in user studies.\n\n\nTakeaway lesson:\n\nInvest a small amount of work to gather data to validate your project assumptions and goals.\n\nContinuously validate product changes with A/B Testing\nIn an A/B test, a random subset of users sees a change or a new feature; everyone else in the control group doesn’t. An A/B testing framework typically assigns users to buckets based on their browser cookie, user ID, or a random number, and the bucket determines the product variant that they see. Assuming there’s no bias in bucket assignment, each bucket gets affected by traffic fluctuations in the same way. Therefore, by comparing metrics across the experimental and control groups, any statistically significant differences can then be attributed solely to differences in the change’s variant. A/B tests provide a scientific way of measuring the effects of the change while controlling for other variations, letting us assess the product’s impact if it’s launched to all users.\nA/B tests also encourage an iterative approach to product development, in which teams validate their theories and iterate toward changes that work.\nBuilding your onw A/B testing framework might seem daunting. Fortunately, there are many existing tools that you can use to test your product hypotheses. Free or open source A/B testing frameworks including:\n\nEtsy's feature-flagging API\nVanity\nGenetify\n\nIf you want more tooling and support, you can pay a monthly fee for software like Optimizely, Apptimize, Unbounce...\n\nWhen deciding what to A/B test, time is your limiting resource. Hone into differences that are high-leverage and practically significant, the ones that actually matter for your particular scale\n\nBeware the One-Person Team\nIn hindsight, it’s clear that if I had just committed my code more iteratively and in chunks, my work wouldn’t have existed in isolation for so long and I would have eliminated a large amount of risk. My mentor would have had a much easier time reviewing my code, and I would have received valuable feedback along the way that I could have applied to future code. In the end, I got lucky: I learned a lesson about solo projects early in my career and with little cost.\nWhile there isn't anything inherently wrong with the working on a one-person project, it does introduce additional risks, that if not addressed, can reduce your chance of success.\n\nFirst and foremost, it adds friction to the process of getting feedback - and you need feedback to help validate that what you're doing will work. It's hard to get good feedback on a code review, for instance, unless the reviewer works on your team and shares your project context. If you're not mindful of setting up a feedback loop, it can be empting to defer getting feedback on something until you think it's nearly perfect. And if you don't find out until the end that you've gone in the wrong direction, you'll waste a lot of effort.\n\nThe lows of a project are more demoralizing when you're working alone. Sand traps that you struggle to get out of monotonous work that you need to grind through, and bugs that seem to defy all understanding become less draining and more bearable when there's someone there to share you pain. A single stall can grind the project to halt, causing deadlines to slip. And similarly, the highs can be less motivating when you're working alone. Celebrating an achievement with teammates is a great way to boost morale. If you work alone, who’s going to give you a high-five when you finally fix that frustrating data corruption bug?\n\n\nEvent if you find yourself working a one-peron project, don't despair:\n\nBe open and receptive to feedback: If you adopt a defensive mindset about your work, it will be difficult for you to listen to feedback - and people will be less willing to offer it in the future. Instead, optimize for learning. View feedback and criticism not as personal attacks but as opportunities for improvement\n\nCommit code early & often: Large code changes are hard to review, take longer to get feedback, and are a big waste of time and work if it turns out there's a desing flaw. Focus on making iterative progress, and use those iterative commits as forcing functions for soliciting feedback.\n\nRequest code reviews from thorough critics: There is a large variance in the rigor with which different engineers review code. If you’re in a hurry to ship something, you might be tempted to send your code review to the engineer who skims and approves. But if you’re optimizing for quality or if you want to make sure your approach works, you’ll find much more leverage asking for a code review from someone who gives thoughtful criticism. It’s better to get harsh feedback from a teammate early on than to get it from users later when something doesn’t work.\n\nAsk to bounce ideas off your teammates: the most direct path to getting feedback is to request it. Research shows that explaining an idea to another person is one of the best ways of learning it yourself; moreover, your explanation might reveal holes in your own understanding\n\nThat said, if you want to keep the feedback channel open in the future, be respectful of your co-workers’ time. Prepare beforehand.\n\n\nDesign the interface or API of a new system first: After your interfact is designed, prototype what the client code would look like if your feature were built. Creating a concrete picture of the interactions will surface poor assumptions or missing requirements, saving you time in the long run\n\nSend out a design document before dvoting your energy to your code\n\nIf possible, structure ongoing projects so that there is some shared context with your teammates: Rather than working on a separate project in parallel with your teammates, consider working together on the same project and tackling the other project together afterwards. Or, consider working in the same focus area as your teammates.\n\n\n\nThe goal of all these strategies is to overcome the friction of collecting feedback when you’re working alone so that you can validate your ideas earlier and more often. \n\nBuild feedback loops for your decisions\nWhether you’re working on large implementation efforts, developing products, or working on teams, it’s important to build feedback loops to validate your ideas. But even more broadly, the principle of validation generalizes to any decision you make.\n\n“When I interviewed Nimrod Hoofien, a Director of Engineering at Facebook, he said that creating a feedback loop is necessary for all aspects of a job. “It applies to recruiting. It applies to team design. It applies to how you build your culture. It applies to your compensation structure,” Hoofien explained. “Any decision you make … should have a feedback loop for it. Otherwise, you’re just … guessing.”\n\nPreviously, when Hoofien was the Senior VP of Engineering at Ooyala, he experimented with various aspects of building effective engineering teams, and built feedback loops to learn from those experiments. For example, when figuring out the optimal number of team members to maximize effectiveness, Hoofien varied the size of the team and looked for obvious dysfunctions.\n\n\"The most common dysfunction is that the team starts behaving like two teams and these two groups will only work on their side of the board\"\n\nThe principle of validation show us that many of our work decisions, which migh take for granted or adopt blindly from other people, in fact are testable hypotheses.\nValidation mean:\n\nformulating a hypotheis about what might work\n\ndesigning an experiment to test it,\n\nunderstanding what good and bad outcomes look like\n\nrunning the experiment \n\nlearning from the result:\n\n\n"},"07-improve-your-project-estimation-skills.html":{"url":"07-improve-your-project-estimation-skills.html","title":"07-improve-your-project-estimation-skills","keywords":"","body":"Improve your project estimation skills\n\n\nImprove your project estimation skills\nUse Accurate Estimates to Drive Project Planning\nBudget for the Unknown\nDefine specific project goals and measurable milestones\nReduce Riks Early\nApproach rewrite projects with extreme caution\nDon't sprint in the middle of a Marathon\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2008, two months after I had joined Ooyala, the engineering team embarked on a mission to completely rewrite our Flash-based video player. Ooyala, an online video startup, helped customers like TV Guide, the Association of Tennis Professionals, Armani, and TechCrunch manage and serve the thousands of videos on their websites. We offered a content management system, video transcoding services, and a player that customers embedded on their web pages to deliver videos to their viewers.\n\n“We knew we wouldn’t be able to ship these and future customer requirements quickly enough without a more reliable foundation. And so we decided to rewrite the player to make it more modular and performant, and to build a cleaner and better-tested codebase.”\n\nDuring one of our weekly meetings, the CTO and the product manager unveiled the write plan and schedule to the 8-person engineering team. Gantt charts broke down the work assignments, showed how long different tasks would take, and mapped out the dependencies between various parts...\n\nIn 2009, after studying over 50,000 software projects, the Standish Group concluded that 44% of projects are delivered late, overbudget, or missing requirements; 24% fail to complete; and the average slipped project overruns its time budget by 79%. \n\nProject estimation is one of the hardest skills that an effective engineer needs to learn. But it's crucial to master: businesses need accurate to make long-term plans for their products...\nWe'll always operate under imperfect information. Therefore, successful project planning requires increasing the accuracy of our project estimates and increasing our ability to adapt to changing requirements.\nUse Accurate Estimates to Drive Project Planning\n\nA good estimate is an estimate that provides a clear enough view of the project reliability to allow the project leadership to make good decisions about how to control the project to hit its targets\n\nHow to effectively handle gaps between the estimates and targets is the focus of this chapter.\nHow do we produce accurae estimates that provide us the flexibility we need?\n\nDecompose the project into granular tasks: When estimating a large project, decompose it into small tasks and estimate each one of them. If a taks will take more than two days, decompose it further. A long estimate is a hiding place for nasty surprises\n\nEstimate based on how long tasks will take, not on how long you or someone else wants them to take: Managers challenge estimates, pushing for tasks to be completed sooner. If you've made your estimates granular, however, you can defend them more easily.\n\nThink of estimates as probability distributions, not best-case scenarios: Because we operate with imperfect information, we instead should consider our estimates as probability distributions over a range of outcomes, spanning the best-case and worst-case scenarios. Instead of telling a product manager or other stakeholder that we’ll finish a feature in 6 weeks, we might instead tell them, There’s a 50% likelihood that we can deliver the feature 4 weeks from now, and a 90% chance that we can deliver it within 8 weeks.\n\nLet the person doing the actual task make the estimate: Divvying up the estimation work also enables more team members to practice estimation skills and builds team-wide visibility into how different members over- or underestimate their work (most people underestimate). When I now need to set project goals, I schedule sessions with my team where we dedicate time to estimate work.\n\nBeware of anchoring bias: Dan Ariely, a Duke professor who studies behavioral economics, conducted an experiment where he asked students to write down the last two digits of their social security number and then estimate the price of a bottle of wine. Students with higher social security number digits estimated significantly higher prices for the wine, sometimes more than twice as high. The arbitrary numbers had subconsciously anchored and affected their estimates. The same effect often happens in software projects where a manager might casually guess at the amount of work required for  a project or ask you for a quick ballark estimate.\n\nUse multiple approaches to estimate the same task: This can help increase confidence that your approach is sound. For example, suppose you're building a new feature, you can:\n\nDecompose the project into granular tasks, estimate each individual taks, and create a bottom estimate \n\nGather historical data on how long it took to build something similar \n\nCount the number of subsystems you have to build and estimate the average time required for each one\n\n\n\nBeware the mythical man-month: Because one woman can give birth to a baby in nine months doesn’t mean that nine women can give birth to a baby in one month.\n\nThe communication overhead from meetings, emails, one-on-ones, discussions... grows quadratically with the size of the team. Moreover, new team members require time to ramp up on a project before they're productive.\n\n\nValidate estimates against historical data If you know that historically, you’ve tended to underestimate by 20%, then you’ll know that it’s worthwhile to scale up your overall estimate by 25%.\n\nUse timeboxing to constrain tasks that can grow in scope: Plan instead to allocate a fixed amount of time, or a time box, to open-ended activities. Rather than estimating that the research will likely take three days, commit to making the best possible decision you can, given the available data after three days.\n\nAllow others to challenge estimates: By reviewing estimates at a team meeting, we can increase accuracy of buy-in at the cost of some additional overhead.\n\n\n\nIteratively validating our ideas can lead us to better engineering outcomes. In the same way, iteratively revising our estimates can lead us to better project outcomes\n\nBudget for the Unknown\nWhat caused the schedule to slip excessively were all the unknown projects and issues that we hadn’t estimated or accounted for at all. These included:\n\nDeveloping a unit testing harness for our new codebase, and writing our own mocking and assertion libraries for testing. These were tasks that we wanted to start doing as a best practice, but they hadn’t been included in the original estimates.\n\nRealizing that a set of style guidelines could improve long-term code quality and that we should develop those guidelines before writing so much code.\n\nGetting interrupted by a few high-priority customer deals, each of which pulled a few engineers off the team for a week or two.\n\nDebugging video corruption issues that would crash Adobe’s player if a user jumped to video frames in certain, difficult-to-reproduce ways on Internet Explorer...\n\n\n\nAs engineers, our jobs typically require us to fix outstanding bugs, conduct interviews, attend team meetings, hold one-on-ones with our managers, participate in pager duty rotations, train new engineers who join the team, respond to email, and tackle many other recurring duties. Once you factor in these details, an 8-hour workday doesn’t actually provide 8 hours of working time on a project.\n\nWhen setting schedules, build in buffer time for the unexpected interruptions. Some combination of them will occur with reasonable probability during long projects. Be explicit about how much time per day each member of the team will realistically spend on a given project.\nSometimes lays out the week-by-week project schedule in a spreadsheet, annotates it with who’s working on what each week, and blocks off the holidays and vacations.\nDefine specific project goals and measurable milestones\nDefine specific goals for a project based on the problem you’re working to solve, and then use milestones to measure progress on those goals. Tamar Bercovici used these techniques to successfully manage one of her large infrastructure projects at Box, the cloud storage company. \n\nIn late 2012, Bercovici's team faced a critical scaling challenge... After researching potential scaling options, Bercovici and her team kicked off a project to shard the massive folder and file tables. The goal was to horizontally partition the two tables so that they could store the partitions, or shards, on different databases... The tricky part was doing it without any downtime\n\nThe project was time-sensitive and involved modifying large swaths of their 800K-line codebase. Every code path that queried one of the two tables needed to be modified and tested\nBercovici used a key strategy for reducing risk: she articulated a clear goal for her project based on a clear problem. The problem was that Box would soon be unable to support its growing traffic on a single database. Her goal was to migrate to a sharded architecture as soon as possible without any downtime.\nThe simple exercise of setting a project goal produces two concrete benefits:\n\nA well-defined goal provides an important filter for separating the must-haves from the nice-to-haves in the task lists.\n\nThe 2nd goal benefit of defining specific project goals is that it builds clarity and alignment across key  stakeholders. Building alignment also helps team members be more accountable for lacal tradeoffs that might hurt global goals.\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, defining a more specific goal than “Rewrite Ooyala’s player in 4 months” would have been an effective way of shortening the project’s timeline. For example, we could have chosen as our goal, “As soon as possible, build a drop-in replacement for the video player that supports dynamically loadable modules, is unit tested, and can later be extended to support additional ad integrations, analytics reports, and video controls.” Doing so would have enabled us to build alignment around the required tasks and the ones that could be deferred and incrementally added later.\n\nEven more effiective than defining specific goals  is outlining measureable milestones to achieve them. This is the secondary complementary strategy that Bercovici's team used to reduce risk. When asked about the status of a certain task or project, our answer is frequently, \"Almost done\", or \"80% code complete\", partly again because we're poor at estimating our status and how much work is left\". A concrete milestone, with a spcified set of features Xy, Y, Z and preferably accompanied by a target completion date, keeps us honest and lets us more accurately measure whether we're on track or far behind\nFor the sharding project, the milestones included:\n\nRefactor the code so that file and folder queries can be sharded, e.g., by converting single-database MySQL joins into application-level joins that can work across multiple databases.\n\nLogically shard the application so that it goes through the motions of looking up a shard’s location but still accesses data from a single database.\n\nMove a single shard to another database.\n\nCompletely shard all file and folder data for all accounts\n\n\n\n“Each milestone was a very clear point where we had introduced some value that we didn’t have before,” Bercovici explained. Milestones act as checkpoints for evaluating the progress of a project and as channels for communicating the team’s progress to the rest of the organization. If we’ve fallen behind, a milestone provides an opportunity to revise our plan, either by extending the deadline or by cutting tasks.\n\nReduce Riks Early\nTackling the riskiest areas first helps us identify any estimation errors associated with them. The techniques to validate our ideas early and often also can defuse the risks associsted with projects.\n\nIf we're switching to a new technology, building a small-scale end-to-end prototype can surface many issues that might arise.\n\nIf we're adopting new backend infrastructure, gaining any early systematic understanidng of its performance and failure characteristics can provide insight into what's needed to make it robust.\n\nIf we're considering a new design to improve application performance, benchmarking core pieces of code can increase confidence that it meets performance goals.\n\n\nIn addition to the specific risks associated with a project, a risk common to all large projects comes during system integration, which almost always takes longer than planned. \nHow can we reduce integration risk? One effective strategy is to build end-to-end scaffolding and do system testing earlier.\n\nStub out incomplete functions and modules, and assemble an end-to-end system as soon as possible, even if it's only partly functional. Front-loading the integration work provides a number of benefits:\n\nFirst, it forces you to think more about the neccessary glue between different pieces and how they interact, which can help refine the integration estimates and reduce project risk.\n\nSecond, if something breaks the end-to-end system during developement, you can identify and fix it along the way, while dealing with much leass ode complexity, rather than scrambling to tackle it at the end \n\nIt amortizes the cost of integration throughout the development process, which helps build a stronger awareness of how much integration work is acutally left.\n\n\n\n\nApproach rewrite projects with extreme caution\nA very common characteristic of software engineers is our desire to rewrite something from scratch. Perhaps the original codebase is littered with technical debt or covered with monkey patches accumulated over time, and we think, Wouldn’t it be nice to redesign it and make it cleaner? Or perhaps the original design was too simple and lacked features—Wouldn’t it be great if we could do X and Y?\n\n“Unfortunately, rewrite projects are also some of the riskiest projects”\n\nRewriting projects are particularly troublesome for a few reasons:\n\nThey share the same project planning and estimation difficulaties as other software projects \n\nBecause we tend to familiar with the original version, we typically underestimate rewrite projects more drastically than we would undertaking in a new area.\n\nIt's easy and tempting to bundle additonal improvement into a rewrite.\n\nWhen a rewrite is ongoing, a new features or improvements must either be added to the rewritten version or they must be duplicated the existing version and the new version.\n\n\n\nEngineers who successfully rewrite systems tend to do so by converting a large rewrite project into a series of smaller projects. They rewrite a software system incrementally, in more controlled phases. They adopt the mindset that Martin Fowler advocates in Refactoring: engineers should use a series of incremental, behavior-preserving transformations to refactor code. “By doing them in small steps you reduce the risk of introducing errors,” Fowler advises. “You also avoid having the system broken while you are carrying out the restructuring—which allows you to gradually refactor a system over an extended period of time.\"\n\nHarry Zhang took a similar approach when rewriting the software that powers the API at Lob. Zhang’s team builds an API for companies to print and mail documents and products. Their codebase had become messy and difficult to work with, and they decided to rewrite their API services in Node.js. Rather than doing it all at once, they built a proxy server that would selectively route traffic for different API endpoints between the old and new API servers. As long as they preserved the interface, they could incrementally deploy their servers to handle new endpoints and also switch back if they encountered errors or issues. The incremental approach gave them significantly more leeway to complete the rewrite while addressing ongoing customers issues.\n\nSometimes, doing an incremental rewrite might not be possible—perhaps there’s no way to simultaneously deploy the old and new versions to different slices of traffic. The “next best approach is to break the rewrite down into separate, targeted phases.\n\nDon't sprint in the middle of a Marathon\nThe team needs to put in 25% more hours—working 50 hours per week instead of 40—for the next two months, in order to hit the deadline. Unfortunately, the actual math is not that simple. There are a number of reasons why working more hours doesn’t necessarily mean hitting the launch date:\n\n“Hourly productivity decreases with additional hours worked.”\n\nYou’re probably more behind schedule than you think The fact that your schedule has slipped means that the work in previous months was underestimated\n\nAdditional hours can burn out team members: Those extra overtime hours come from somewhere, people are sacrificing time that would otherwise be spent with friends, family...\n\nWorking extra hours can hurt team dynamics: Not everyone on the team will have the flexibility to pitch in the extra hours. \n\nCommunication overhead increases as the deadline looms. A frenzy of activity often accompanies the days or weeks leading up to the launch date...\n\n\nHaving said this, at times you’ll still be in situations where you think a small dose of overtime is necessary to hit a key deadline:\n\nMaking sure everyone understands the primary causes for why the timeline has slipped thus far.\n\nDeveloping a realistic and revised version of the project plan and timeline\n\nBeing ready to abandon the sprint if you slip even further from the revised timeline.\n\n\n"},"08-build-quality-with-pragmatism.html":{"url":"08-build-quality-with-pragmatism.html","title":"08-build-quality-with-pragmatism","keywords":"","body":"Balance Quality with Pragmatism\n\n\nBalance Quality with Pragmatism\nEstablish a sustainable Code Review Process\nManage Complexity through Abstraction\nAutomate Testing\nRepay Technical Debt\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has exceptionally high coding standards. Programming style guides dictate conventions for C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and other languages used within the company. \nGoogle even requires engineers to formally pass a readability review for each programming language that they use at the company.\nThis high bar for code quality has enabled an organization of over 45,000 employees distributed across offices in over 60 countries to scale incredibly effectively.\n\nThe engineering practices that work for Google would be overkill at a startup or a small company. Requiring new engineers to read and pass a readability review would add unnecessary overhead to getting things done. Imposing strict coding standards on prototypes or experiments that might get thrown away would stifle new ideas. Writing tests and thoroughly reviewing prototype code might make sense, but blanket requirements don’t. It’s possible to over-invest in quality, to the point where there are diminishing returns for time spent.\nUltimately, software quality boils down to a matter of tradeoffs, and there’s no one universal rule for how to do things.\n\nHigh software quality enables organizations to scale and increases the rate at which engineers can produce value\nUnderinvest in quality can hamper your ability to move quickly\n\nOn the other hand, it’s also possible to be overly dogmatic about code reviews, standardization, and test coverage—to the point where the processes provide diminishing returns on quality and actually reduce your effectiveness. \nWe'll examine several strategies for building a high-quality codebase and consider the tradeoffs involved: the pros, the cons and the pragmatic approaches for implementing them.\nEstablish a sustainable Code Review Process\nThe benefits of code reviews are obvisous:\n\nCaching bugs or design shortcomings early\n\nIncreasing accountability for code changes: you're much les likely to add a quick and dỉty moneky patch to the code and leave the mess for another person to fix\n\nPosititive modeling of how to write good code: Code reviews provide an avenue for sharing best practices, and engineers can learn from their own code reviews as well as from others.\n\nSharing working knowledge of the codebase.\n\nIncreasing long-term agility: Higher-quality code is easier to understand, quicker to modify, and less susceptible to bugs. These all translate directly into faster iteration speed for the engineering team. \n\n\n\nAlthough they usually acknowledge that code reviews can improve quality, engineers who don’t do them often cite their concern about their impact on iteration speed.\n\nThere’s a tradeoff between the additional quality that code reviews can provide and the short-term productivity win from spending that time to add value in other ways.\nGiven these tradeoffs, does it make sense to do code reviews? Successfully navigating this question requires a key insight: deciding on code reviews doesn’t need to be a binary choice, where all code is either reviewed or not reviewed. Rather, think of code reviews as being on a continuum. They can be structured in different ways to reduce their overhead while still maintaining their benefits.\n\nAt one extreme, there's google which requires all code changes to be reviewed\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, smaller teams employ much nimbler code review process\n\nSquare and Twitter often use pair programming in place of code reviews\n\nAt Quora, we only required reviews of model and controller code for business logic; view code that rendered the web interface to users didn't need to be reviewed. Code that touched hairy infrastructure internals tended to be riskier, so we frequently reviewed those types of changes before they were committed\n\nToday, code review tools like GitHub and Phabricator provide lightweight web interfaces. When engineers mention a teammate’s name in a commit message, facilities like git hooks can automatically send a code review request to that person. Reviewers can make inline comments right in a web interface, easily seeing what changed since the last round of feedback. Lint checkers can automatically identify deviations from style guidelines, boosting consistency. 16 17 These tools all help reduce code review friction and focus engineering time on what matters: getting valuable feedback to the implementer.\n\n\nManage Complexity through Abstraction\nHow the right abstraction increases engineering productivity:\n\nIt reduces the complexity of the original problem into easier-to-understand primitives.\n\nIt reduces future application maintenance and makes it easier to apply future improvements\n\nIt solves the hard problems once and enables the solutions to be used multiple times.\n\n\nSimilar to time-saving tools, right abstractions can increase productivity by an order of magnitude. Strong engineering teams invest heavily in these abstractions. In addition to MapReduce, Google built Protocol Buffers to encode structured data in an extensible way.\nBuilding an abstraction for a problem comes with tradeoffs. Building a generalized solution takes more time than building one specific to a given problem. To break even, the time saved by the abstraction for future engineers needs to outweigh the time invested.\n\n“Create an abstraction too early, before you have a firm handle on the general problem you’re solving, and the resulting design can be overfitted to the available use cases.”\n“Simple abstractions avoid interweaving multiple concepts, so that you can reason about them independently rather than being forced to consider them together. Techniques such as avoiding mutable state, using functional rather than imperative programming, preferring composition over inheritance, and expressing data manipulations declaratively rather than imperatively are just a few examples of how to reduce incidental complexity when building software.”\n\nGood abstractions should be:\n\nEasy to learn \n\nEasy to use even without documentation \n\nHard to misuse\n\nSufficiently powerful to satisfy requirements\n\nEasy to extend\n\nAppropriate to the audience\n\n\nDesigning good abstractions take work. Study other people’s abstractions to learn how to build good ones yourself. Because the adoption of an abstraction scales with its ease of use and its payoffs, an abstraction’s usage and popularity provides a reasonable proxy for its quality. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\nFind popular abstractions in your codebase at work or from repositories on GitHub. Read through their documentation, dig through their source code, and try extending them.\n\nLook through the open source projects at technology companies like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Learn why abstractions like Protocol Buffers, Thrift, Hive, and MapReduce have been indispensable to their growth.\n\nStudy the interfaces of popular APIs developed by Parse, Stripe, Dropbox, Facebook, and Amazon Web Services, and figure out what makes it so easy for developers to build on top of their platforms. Also reflect on APIs that you or the rest of community don’t like, and understand what you don’t like about them.\n\n\nAutomate Testing\n\nUnit test coverage and some degree of integration test coverage provide a scalable way of managing a growing codebase with a large team without constantly breaking the build or the product\n\n\nAutomated testing doesn't just reduce bugs, it also:\n\nDecrease repetitive work that we’d otherwise need to do by hand.\n\nLeads engineers to be much more accountable for the quality of their own work.\n\nTests also allow engineers to make changes, especially large refactorings, with significantly higher confidence.\n\n\n\nAutomated tests mitigate against a culture in which people are fearful of modifying and improving a piece of code because it might break\n\n\nTests offer executable documentation of what cases the original author considered and how to invoke the code.\n\n\nJust because automated testing is beneficial, however, doesn’t mean that building automated tests for everything is always a good idea. 100% code coverage is difficult to achieve. Some code is harder to test automatically than others. Moreover, unless you’re working on mission-critical or safety-critical pieces of software, dogmatically requiring test coverage for all code is unlikely to be the best use of your time. The extent to which you should automate testing again boils down to a matter of tradeoffs\n\nDespite its benefits, it can be difficult to foster a culture of automated testing. \n\nThere may be organizational inertia: people may believe writing unit tests will reduce their iteration speed.\n\nWriting the first test is often the hardest. An effective way to initiate the habit of testing, particularly when working with a large codebase with few automated tests, is to focus on high-leverage tests—ones that can save you a disproportionate amount of time relative to how long they take to write. Once you have a few good tests, testing patterns, and libraries in place, the effort required to write future tests drops. That tips the balance in favor of writing more tests, creating a virtuous feedback cycle and saving more development time. \n\nStart with the most valuable tests, and go from there.\n\nRepay Technical Debt\n\nSometimes, we build things in a way that makes sense in the short-term but that can be costly in the long-term. We work around design guidelines because it’s faster and easier than following them. We punt on writing test cases for a new feature because there’s too much work to finish before the deadline. We copy, paste, and tweak small chunks of existing code instead of refactoring it to support our use cases. Each of these tradeoffs, whether they’re made from laziness or out of a conscious decision to ship sooner, can increase the amount of technical debt in our codebase.\n\nTechnical debt doesn’t just accumulate when we make quick and dirty workarounds. Whenever we write software without fully understanding the problem space, our first version will likely end up being less cleanly designed than we’d like. Over time, we develop new insights into better ways of doing things. Since our initial understanding of problems always will be incomplete, incurring a little debt is unavoidable; it’s just part of getting things done\n\nThe key to being a more effective engineer is to incur technical debt when it’s necessary to get things done for a deadline, but to pay off that debt periodically. As Martin Fowler, author of the book Refactoring, points out, “The all too common problem is that development organizations let their debt get out of control and spend most of their future development effort paying crippling interest payments.\n\nDifferent organizations use various strategies to manage technical debt:\n\nAsana, a startup that builds an online productivity tool, schedules a Polish and Grease Week at the end of every quarter to pay off any UI and internal tools debt that they might have accumulated. \n\nQuora devotes a day after every week-long hackathon to do cleanup work. Some companies explicitly schedule rewrite projects (with their attendant risks) when their technical debt gets too high, evidenced by slow development speed visibly taxing the team’s ability to execute. \n\nGoogle holds Fixit days like Docs Fixit, Customer Happiness Fixit, or Internationalization Fixit—where engineers are encouraged to tackle specific themes—as a lightweight mechanism to pay off technical debt.\n\nLinkedIn, for example, paused feature development for two whole months after the company went public. They used the downtime to fix a broken process—engineers were taking a month to deploy new features—and then resumed development at a much faster rate\n\n\n\n\"I once organized a Code Purge Day where a group of teammates and I deleted code that was no longer being used from the codebase. It was a small but focused effort with little risk of failure—plus, who doesn’t like the feeling of getting rid of unused code? We purged about 3% of our application-level code, and it was easy to justify because it saved other engineers wasted time navigating around stale and irrelevant parts of the codebase.\"\n\nUnfortunately, technical debt often is hard to quantify. Not all technical debt is worth repaying. Rather than blindly repaying technical debt wherever they find it, effective engineers spend their finite time repaying the debt with the highest leverage—code in highly-trafficked parts of the codebase that takes the least time to fix up.\n"},"09-minimize-operational-burden.html":{"url":"09-minimize-operational-burden.html","title":"09-minimize-operational-burden","keywords":"","body":"Minimize Operational Burden\n\n\nMinimize Operational Burden\nEmbrace Operational Simplicity\nBuild system to fail fast\nRelentlessly Automate Mechanical Tasks\nMake batch process idempotent\nHone your ability to respond and recover quickly\n\n\n\n\nFew other mobile apps have grown at Instagram’s pace. Scaling a product to support that much growth in such a short period of time would be extremely challenging for any team. What’s surprising, however, is that when Instagram was acquired in April 2012, it had only 13 employees. Its ratio of users to employees was over 3 million to one—much higher than most other companies. This was a testament to just how effective each member of that small team was.\n\nKeeping a system up and running, scaling a feature to support more users, fixing the bugs that surface, transferring an ever-growing body of institutional knowledge to new engineers—all of these costs continue to tax a team’s resources, even after a feature or system ships. When a team is small, minimizing that tax is critical.\n“Unfortunately, it is tough to fully internalize this cost. Even the smartest and most talented engineers can become enamored with the hottest new technologies and dream of ways of incorporating them into their next project. They’ll try out a new system that’s yet to find major adoption, a new language that few team members know, or some experimental piece of infrastructure, all without factoring in the future maintenance costs. These decisions impose an ongoing cost on their time and reduce their engineering efficiency.”\n\nThis is why minimizing operational burden is so critical\n\nWhenever they could, the Instagram team picked proven and solid technologies instead of shiny or sexy new ones. Whereas many other startup teams adopted trendy NoSQL data stores and then struggled to manage and operate them, the Instagram team stuck with tried and true options like PostgreSQL, Memcache, and Redis that were stable, easy to manage, and simple to understand.\nEmbrace Operational Simplicity\n\nOne of the core engineering tenets is to do the simple thing first,” Krieger explained. “We apply that to product. We apply that to hiring. We apply it to engineering. We have posters that say it.\n\nWhen asked what he’d learned from designing the iPod, Steve Jobs responded, “When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don’t put in the time or energy to get there.\nWhen engineering teams don’t focus on doing the simple thing first, they either end up being less effective over time because their energy is spent on a high upkeep cost, or they reach a point where the operational burden gets so high that they’re forced to simplify their architecture.\nHaving too complex of an architecture imposes a maintenance cost in a few ways:\n\nEngineering expertise gets splintered across multiple systems\n\nIncreased complexity introduces more potential single points of failure\n\nNew engineers face a steeper learning curve when learning and understanding the new systems\n\nEffort towards improving abstractions, libraries and tools get diluted across the different systems.\n\n\n\nWhen system complexity grows faster than the engineering team’s ability to maintain the system, productivity and progress suffer. More and more time gets diverted towards maintenance and figuring out how things work; less time is spent finding new ways to build value\n\nInstagram and Pinterest demonstrate that the descipline to focus on simplicity provides high leverage:\n\nIt's fine to experiment with a new programming language for a prototype or a toy project, but think hard before using it in a new production system.\n\nProponents of new data stores promise that their systems solve the problems in battle-tested relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. Before using these new storage systems in production, however, do your research. Find out if other teams have successfully used them for projects of a similar scope and whether they have actually been able to maintain and scale them with lower operational burden than more standard solutions.\n\nWhen tackling a new problem, consider whether repurposing an existing abstraction or tool would be simpler than developing a custom solution.\n\nIf you’re processing large amounts of data, consider whether the data is actually large enough such that you need a distributed cluster, or whether a single, beefy machine will suffice.\n\n\n\nRemember: do the ismple thing first. Always ask: What's the simplest solution that can get the job done while also reducing our future operational burden?\n\nBuild system to fail fast\nMany engineers associate robustness and reliability with an absence of crashes. They spend their energy adding workarounds to automatically handle software errors so that their programs can continue to function. Workarounds may include setting misconfigured parameters to default values, adding catch-all exception handlers to deal with unexpected issues, and swallowing unexpected return values.\n\nThese techniques cause software to fail slowly. This is often in exchange for less decipherable bugs further down the road\n\nSlowly failing systems muddy the sources of code errors, making it difficult for us to discover what went wrong.\n\n“[In] a system that fails fast …, when a problem occurs, it fails immediately and visibly. Failing fast is a nonintuitive technique: ‘failing immediately and visibly’ sounds like it would make your software more fragile, but it actually makes it more robust. Bugs are easier to find and fix, so fewer go into production” (Jim Shore, \"IEEE Software\")\n\nExamples of failing fast include:\n\nCrashing at startup time when encountering configuration errors\n\nValidating software inputs, particularly if they won’t be consumed until much later\n\nAlerting engineers about any invalid or inconsistent program state as early as possible\n\n\nFailing fast doesn’t necessarily mean crashing your programs for users. You can take a hybrid approach: use fail-fast techniques to surface issues immediately and as close to the actual source of error as possible; and complement them with a global exception handler that reports the error to engineers while failing gracefully to the end user. \nRelentlessly Automate Mechanical Tasks\nThe cost of automating (including learning how to automate) may initially be higher than the cost of doing the job manually. However, if the experience increases the efficiency with which you can automate in the future, that skill will compound and pay for itself as you use automation for more and more problems.\nFacebook runs one of the largest MySQL database installations in the world, with many thousands of servers across multiple data centers. Each Facebook user’s profile is assigned to one of many thousands of partitions, called shards, and each database server contains multiple shards. If a server fails (and tens or hundreds might fail on a given day) or a shard gets too big, one or more shards need to be redistributed to another database server.\nThere are 2 types of automation: \n\nAutomating the mechanics of a sequence of steps tends to be straightforward and testable. \n\nAutomating the right decisions to make, particularly in the context of building systems that can heal and repair themselves when things go wrong, turns out to be much more challenging.\n\n\n\nAnd so, for a long time, to balance database shards at Facebook, an engineer ran a script to look for the most overloaded machines and then ran another script to move some shards off of those machines. The mechanics of moving a shard from one database server to another was heavily automated, but a human decided which of thousands of shards to move where. It would be many years before Facebook reached the point in their development where it was worthwhile to tackle the harder task of decision automation. They ultimately deployed a system called MySQL Pool Scanner to automatically rebalance shards.\n\nSee more at Under the hood: MySQL Pool Scanner (MPS)\nAutomation can produce diminishing returns as you move from automating mechanics to automating decision-making. Given your finite time, focus first on automating mechanics. Only after you’ve picked all the low-hanging fruit should you try to address the much harder problem of automating smart decisions.\nMake batch process idempotent\nAs you automate more operations, your time’s leverage increases—but so does the probability that some of your automation will fail. Scripts executing a sequence of actions without human intervention (also known as batch processes) that you schedule to run periodically, will hit network timeouts or unexpected hiccups. Scripts processing large amounts of data, increasingly common as data analytics become key to more businesses, work most of the time, but they take a long time to retry or recover when they fail. If you’re not careful, the time required to maintain your automation will climb. Therefore, minimizing that burden is a high-leverage activity.\nOne technique to make batch processes easier to maintain and more resilient to failure is to make them idempotent. An idempotent process produces the same results regardless of whether it’s run once or multiple times.\nWhen idempotence isn’t possible, structuring a batch process so that it’s at least retryable or reentrant can still help. A retryable or reentrant process is able to complete successfully after a previous interrupted call. A process that’s not reentrant typically leaves side effects on some global state that prevents it from successfully completing on a retry. For instance, a failed process might still be holding onto a global lock or have emitted partial output; designing the process so that it knows how to handle these inconsistent states can reduce the amount of manual handholding required later. Make each process either fail entirely or succeed entirely.\nIdempotence also offers another benefit that many effective engineers take advantage of: the ability to run infrequent processes at a more frequent rate than strictly necessary, to expose problems sooner\n\nRajiv Eranki, a former Dropbox engineer responsible for scaling infrastructure from 4K to 40M users, even suggests scheduling scripts intended only for manual invocation (like scripts to fix user state or to run diagnostics) to be run regularly to detect errors.\n\nRunning batch processes more frequently also allows you to handle assorted glitches transparently\n\nIdempotence and reentrancy can reduce some of the complexity and recurring costs involved in maintaining automated and batch processes. They make automation cheaper, freeing you to work on other things.\n\nHone your ability to respond and recover quickly\nAt Netflix, engineers did something counterintuitive: they built a system called Chaos Monkey that randomly kills services in its own infrastructure... It turns out that this strategy actually makes their infrastructure more robust and reduces the pain of pager duty\n\n\"The best defense against major unexpected failures is to fail often.\"\n\nHow we handle failures plays a large role in our effectiveness. And at some point, it becomes higher leverage to focus our time and energy on our ability to recover quickly than on preventing failures in the first place. The better our tools and processes for recovering quickly from failures, and the more we practice using them, the higher our confidence and the lower our stress levels. This allows us to move forward much more quickly.\nSimulating failures accurately is difficult, and because they happen infrequently, the payoff for handling them better seems lower than working on more pressing product issues. Recovery processes to handle server failures, database failovers, and other failure modes therefore tend to be inadequate at best.\nOne strategy for fixing this imbalance comes from Bill Walsh, former coach of the San Francisco 49ers. In The Score Takes Care of Itself, Walsh discusses a strategy called scripting for success\n\nWalsh wrote scripts, or contingency plans, for how to respond to all types of game scenarios.\n\nLike Walsh, we too can script for success and shift our decision-making away from high-stakes and high-pressure situations and into more controlled environments. As engineers, we can even programmatically script our responses and test them to ensure that they’re robust. This is particularly important as an engineering organization grows and any infrastructure that can fail will begin to fail.\n\nAt Dropbox, the engineering team often simulates additional load for their production systems. Doing so enables them to artificially trigger issues sooner; when they hit a system limit that causes errors, they disable the simulated load and have ample time to investigate the issue.\n\nAsk what if questions and work through contingency plans for handling different situations:\n\nWhat if a critical bug gets deployed as part of a release? How quickly can we roll it back or respond with a fix, and can we shorten that window?\n\nWhat if a database server fails? How do we fail over to another machine and recover any lost data?\n\nWhat if our servers get overloaded? How can we scale up to handle the increased traffic or shed load so that we respond correctly to at least some of the requests?\n\nWhat if our testing or staging environments get corrupted? How would we bring up a new one?\n\nWhat if a customer reports an urgent issue? How long would it take customer support to notify engineering? How long for engineering to follow up with a fix?\n\n\nPracticing our failure scenarios so that we can recover quickly applies more generally to other aspect of software engineering as well:\n\nWhat if a manager or other stakeholder at an infrequent review meeting raises objections about the product plan?\n\nWhat if a critical team member gets sick or injured, or leaves? How can we share knowledge so that the team continues to function?\n\n..\n\n\n"},"10-invest-in-your-team-growth.html":{"url":"10-invest-in-your-team-growth.html","title":"10-invest-in-your-team-growth","keywords":"","body":"Invest in your team's growth\n\n\nInvest in your team's growth\nMake hiring everyone's responsibility\nDesign a Good onboarding process\nShare ownership of Code\nBuild Collective Wisdom through Post-Mortems\nBuild a great engineering culture\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest lessons I learned from Ooyala is that investing in a positive, smooth onboarding experience is extremely valuable. \n\nInvesting in onboarding is just one way to invest in your team’s growth. The people and the team that you work with have a significant impact on your own effectiveness—and you don’t have to be a manager or a senior engineer to influence your team’s direction. For some people, developing a team may be less enjoyable than developing software. But if you want to increase your effectiveness, it’s important to recognize that building a strong team and a positive culture has a considerable amount of leverage.\n\nThe higher you climb up the engineering ladder, the more your effectiveness will be measured not by your individual contributions but by your impact on the people around you.\n\nCompanies like Google, Facebook, and others all have similar criteria for senior engineers, staff engineers, principal engineers, distinguished engineers, and their equivalent positions: the higher the level, the higher the expected impact.\n\n\"You’re a staff engineer if you’re making a whole team better than it would be otherwise. You’re a principal engineer if you’re making the whole company better than it would be otherwise. And you’re distinguished if you’re improving the industry.\"\n\"The secret to your own career success is to “focus primarily on making everyone around you succeed.\"\n\nMake hiring everyone's responsibility\nInterviewing new engineering candidates can feel bothersome. It interrupts productivity and breaks up our day, and it’s time-consuming to write feedback on candidates and debrief with the team. If the recruiting pipeline is not set up well, interviews can feel like hit-or-miss sessions with unqualified candidates who bomb our questions\nIt’s only when we look at interviews in the aggregate do we realize that hiring is an extremely high-leverage activity. The smaller the company—and the more likely that the person you interview will be an immediate co-worker—the greater the leverage of those interviews.\nSo how do we design an effective interview process? A good interview process achieves two goals:\n\nIt screens for the type of people we likely to do well on the team\n\nIt gets candidates excited about the team, the mission and the cultures. Even if a candidate goes home without an offer, they still leave with a good impression of the team and refer their friends to interview with the company.\n\n\nAs an interviewer, your goal is to optimize for questions with high signal-to-noise ratios - questions that reveal a large amount of useful information (signal) about the candidate per minute spent, with little irrelevant or useless data (noise)\nThe types of questions that generate the most signal depend on the qualities most correlated with success on your team. Traditionally, many large technology companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon require engineering candidates to answer algorithm and coding questions on a whiteboard. These textbook-style questions evaluate a candidate’s computer science knowledge, but they can often fall short in gauging whether an engineer actually gets things done in a work environment.\nAn increasing number of companies have shifted toward interviews that include a hands-on programming component. \n\nAt Quora, for example, we augmented our suite of whiteboard interviews with a practical coding exercise on a laptop. Candidates navigated around, debugged, and extended a large, open-source codebase in their favorite text editors, and they used Google, Stack Overflow, or other online resources as needed. The exercise revealed whether someone could effectively use a terminal, invoke basic UNIX commands, dive into unfamiliar libraries, set up a tight development loop, and write clean code—all of which were valuable signals not well captured by the traditional whiteboard interview.\n\nAt the payments startup Stripe, the team similarly designed its on-site interviews to simulate the work that their engineers do on a day-to-day basis. Problems included designing and implementing a small end-to-end system, squashing bugs in a popular open-source codebase, refactoring a poorly organized application, and pair programming on a self-contained project.\n\n\nPerhaps trickier than the choice of questions is how to continuously iterate on improving your interview process.\n\nTake time with your team to identify which qualities in a potential teammate you care about the most:\n\ncoding aptitude\nmastery of programming languages\nalgorithms, data structures\nproduct skills\ndebugging\ncommunication skills\nculture fit, or something else.\n\n\nPeriodically meet to discuss how effective the current recruiting and interview processes are at finding new hires who succeed on the team. Keep on iterating until you find ways to accurately assess the skills and qualities that your team values\n\nDesign interview problems with multiple layers of difficulty that you can tailor to the candidate’s ability by adding or removing variables and constraints. Building a fast search interface can, for instance, be made harder by requiring the search query to be distributed across multiple machines.\n\nControl the interview pace to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio. Don’t let interviewees ramble, get stumped, or get sidetracked for too long.\n\nScan for red flags by rapidly firing short-answer questions to probe a wide surface area.\n\nPeriodically shadow or pair with another team member during interviews. These sessions help calibrate ratings across interviewers and provide opportunities to give each other feedback on improving the interview process\n\n\nDesign a Good onboarding process\nIn a small team, there aren’t many places to look or people to consult when you’re trying to figure out what’s most important. As the team grows and the surface area of new things to explore increases, it becomes harder and harder for a recent hire to figure out what to learn first without any guidance.\nA quality onboarding process is a powerful leverage point for increasing team effectiveness. First impressions matter.\n\nSo I researched Google’s EngEDU training program and Facebook’s 6-week Bootcamp onboarding program, and I reached out to engineers at different companies to learn what had and hadn’t worked for them. Based on my research, I formally defined the role of engineering mentorship at Quora and organized a recurring series of onboarding talks.\n\nOne component of Quora's new onboarding program is pairing each hire with a mentor. Mentors assign small features or bugs from their task list to do as a starter project. These are great learning opportunities for new hires, since the mentors have context for each project and can provide guidance and answer questions. It also frees mentors to shift their attention from less-interesting tasks to higher-leverage projects that they are better suited to tackle. Onboarding is a win-win situation; the new hires receive valuable training, and the mentors get more things done.\n\nInsufficient training means it’s harder to accurately identify low performers—are they doing poorly because they were bad hires, or do they just need more time to acclimate?\n\nSo how do you create a good onboarding process for your team?\n\nFirst, identify the goals that your team wants to achieve.\n\nSecond, construct a set of mechanisms to accomplish these goals.\n\n\nFor examples, here are four goals:\n\nRamp up new engineers as quickly as possible. Onboarding does require a short-term productivity hit for those leading it. The sooner new employees get ramped up, however, the sooner they’ll produce meaningful output—enabling the team to get more done in the long run\n\nImpart the team's culture and values: Those values might include getting things done, being data-driven, working well as a team, building high-quality products and services...\n\nExpose new engineers to the breadth of fundamentals needed to succeed.\n\nSocially integrate new engineers onto the team. This means creating opportunities for them to meet and develop working relationships with other teammates.\n\n\nUsing these above goals, we developed the four main pillars for Quora's onboarding program:\n\nCodelabs: A codelab is a document explaining why a core abstraction was designed and how it's used, walks through relevant parts of its core internals, and supplies programming exercises to validate understanding. We created codelabs to teach new engineers the fundamentals of how we built Quora\n\nI invested extra effort to create the first codelab that others could use as a model; I then scaled the effort by recruiting teammates to pitch in\n\n\nOnboarding talks: We organized a series of ten onboarding talks to be delivered during a new hire's first three weeks. These talks, given by senior engineers on the team, introduced the codebase and site architecture, explained and demoed our different development tools, covered engineering expectations and values around topics like unit testing, and introduced key focus areas\n\nMentorship: Because each new hire’s background is different, onboarding programs can’t be one-size-fits-all. Quora paired each new hire with a mentor to provide more personalized training during their first few months. Mentors checked in daily with their mentees during the first week, and then met for weekly 1:1s. Responsibilities included everything from reviewing code, discussing design tradeoffs, and planning work priorities, to introducing new hires to the right people on the team and helping them acclimate to the fast pace of a startup. Quora also held mentoring workshops and meetings to exchange tips and help mentors improve.\n\nStarter tasks: New engineers pushed commits to add themselves to the team page on their first day, and we aimed for each of them to complete a starter task—whether it be deploying a bug fix, a small new feature, or a new experiment—by the end of the first week\n\n\n\n“It’s important to realize that building a good onboarding program is an iterative process.”\n\nShare ownership of Code\nThere’s a common misconception that being the sole engineer responsible for a project increases your value. After all, if fewer people know what you know, then the scarcity of your knowledge translates into higher demand and value, right? What I’ve learned, however, is that sharing code ownership benefits not only yourself but your entire team as well. As you increase in seniority, your responsibilities as an engineer also grow. You become the point-person for more projects, and other engineers consult with you more frequently.\nTo increase shared ownership, reduce the friction that other team members might encounter while browsing, understanding, and modifying code that you write or tools that you build. Here are some strategies:\n\nAvoid one-person teams\n\nReview each other's code and software designs\n\nRotate different types of tasks and responsiblities across the team\n\nKeep code readable and code quality high\n\nPresent tech talks on software decisions and architecture\n\nDocument your software\n\nDocument the complex workflows or non-obvious workarounds necessary for you to get things done.\n\nInvest time in teaching and mentoring other team members\n\n\nBuild Collective Wisdom through Post-Mortems\nIn our haste to get things done, we often move from task to task and project to project without pausing to reflect on how effectively we spent our time or what we could have done better. Developing the habit of regular prioritization provides one opportunity for retrospection. Another valuable opportunity comes from debriefing after incidents and projects and sharing lessons more widely across other teams\nThe goal of the post-mortem is not to assign blame, which can be counter-productive to the discussion, but to work together to identify better solutions. If the situation is not preventable, the post-mortem may prompt the team to:\n\nbuild new tools to recover easier\n\ncompile a step-by-step document that explains how to deal with similar situations\n\n\nThe post-mortem write-up generally gets shared across teams, since many people in the organization want to know what happened.\nCompanies like Amazon and Asana use methodologies like Toyota’s “Five Whys” to understand the root cause of operational issues. For examples: \n\nWhy were they overloaded?” Because a disproportionately high fraction of traffic was hitting a few servers.\n\nWhy wasn't traffic more randomly distributed? Because the requests were all coming from the same customer, and their data is only hosted on those machines.\n\n\n\n“By the time the fifth why is asked, they’ve moved from the symptom to the root cause.”\n\nUltimately, compiling team lessons is predicated upon honest conversation—and holding an honest conversation about a project can be uncomfortable. \n\nIt requires acknowledging that months of effort may have resulted in failure, and viewing the failure as an opportunity for growth.\n\nIt requires aligning behind a common goal of improving the product or team, and not focusing on where to assign blame. \n\nIt requires being open and receptive to feedback, with the goal of building collective wisdom around what went wrong and what could’ve been done better.\n\n\nBut if a difficult hour-long conversation can increase the chances that your next month-long team project succeeds, it’s high-leverage and well worth both the time and the emotional investment.\nIt’s difficult to instill a culture of collective learning into an entire organization. However, consistent applications of effort can go a long way. Start with small projects that you’re working on with your immediate team; gradually establish the practice of doing post-mortems after larger projects as well. The more you learn from each experience, the more you’ll take with you into your next project, and the more you’ll succeed. Optimize for collective learning\nBuild a great engineering culture\nEngineering culture consists of the set of values and habits shared by people on the team, and a great culture provides a number of benefits. Engineers feel empowered to get things done, which makes them happier and more productive. Happy and productive engineers in turn translate to higher employee retention. The culture provides a shared context and a framework for making decisions, which helps teams and organizations adapt more quickly to problems they encounter. And because the best engineers look for a strong engineering culture, it becomes a useful tool for recruiting talent. Hiring those engineers further strengthens the culture and creates a positive feedback loop.\nSo what do the best engineers look for in a prospective company?\n\n\nOptimize for iteration speed\n\n\n\nPush relentless towards automation\n\n\n\nBuild the right software abtractions\n\n\n\nFocus on high code quality by using code reviews\n\n\n\nBuild shared ownership of code\n\n\n\nMaintain a respectful work environment\n\n\n\nInvest in automated testing\n\n\n\nAllot experimentation time, either through 20% time or hackathons\n\n\n\nFoster a culture of learning and continuous improvement\n\n\n\nHire the best\n\n\n\nA great engineering culture isn’t built in a day; nor is it already in place when a company first starts. It begins with the values of the initial team members, and it’s a continual work-in-progress that every engineer helps to shape. It evolves over time with the decisions we make, the stories we tell, and the habits we adopt. It helps us make better decisions, adapt more quickly, and attract stronger talent. And when we focus on high-leverage activities, we not only become more effective engineers, we also lay the groundwork for a more effective engineering culture.\n"},"11-appendix.html":{"url":"11-appendix.html","title":"11-appendix","keywords":"","body":"Appendix\n\nAppendix\n10 Books Every Effective Engineer Should Read\nBlogs to follow\n\n\n\n10 Books Every Effective Engineer Should Read\n\nPeopleware: Productive Projects and Teams: this book discusses the many dynamics within projects and teams, presenting ideas backed up by actual research.
